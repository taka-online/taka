# Taka — Business Plan

## Executive Summary

Taka is a football strategy company operating across two interconnected verticals:

**B2C: Taka Game** — A turn-based football strategy game (physical board game + online) that distills real tactical decision-making into an accessible, competitive format.

**B2B: Taka Decision Engine** — A similarity-based analytics system that helps coaches and analysts understand what actually works in specific game situations.

**The connection:** The game teaches the same tactical thinking the engine measures. They reinforce each other — the game builds audience and validates the tactical framework; the engine provides credibility and insights that improve the game.

---

## The Vision

Football is the world's most popular sport, but tactical understanding remains trapped in:
- Expensive professional analytics tools
- Abstract coaching jargon
- Inaccessible video analysis

**Taka makes tactical football intelligence accessible** — through play (the game) and through data (the engine).

---

## Part 1: Taka Game (B2C)

### What It Is

A turn-based football strategy game where every decision mirrors real tactical choices:
- Movement trade-offs (with ball vs without)
- Passing angles and facing direction
- Defensive positioning and tackling
- Offside, pressing, space creation

**Not a simulation. Not FIFA.** A strategy game that captures the essence of football decision-making.

## Part 2: Taka Decision Engine (B2B)

### What It Is

A similarity-based analytics system that answers: **"Given this situation, what has historically worked?"**

Using tracking data and event data, the engine:
1. Encodes game situations as continuous features (defensive shape, pressure, positioning)
2. Finds similar historical situations from a database of real matches
3. Analyzes what actions succeeded in those situations
4. Returns actionable insights grounded in real outcomes

### Why It's Different

| Existing Tools | Taka Decision Engine |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Aggregate stats (xG, pass %) | Situation-specific analysis |
| What happened | What works in similar situations |
| Generic insights | Tailored to your game model |
| Requires analyst interpretation | Actionable recommendations |

### Core Capabilities

**Situation Analysis:**
> "Ball in left half-space, opponent in mid-block with high line..."
> → "In 47 similar situations, switching to weak side succeeded 62% vs 38% for central play"

**Opponent Scouting:**
> "Against Kentucky's 4-4-2..."
> → "Their LB takes 2.8s to recover (league avg 2.1s). Target that channel."

**Decision Quality:**
> "At 34:22, #8 played central..."
> → "Switch was available with 0.15 higher expected value. Here's the video."

**Game Model Alignment:**
> "For BGZ buildups this season..."
> → "Executing to game model 68% of situations. Main gap: early switches."

### Target Customers

| Segment | Size | Price Point | Value Prop |
|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| College soccer (D1) | 200+ programs | $10-25K/year | Competitive edge, recruitment tool |
| MLS / USL | 50+ teams | $50-100K/year | Opponent analysis, player development |
| European academies | 100+ | $25-50K/year | Player evaluation, tactical training |
| National federations | 50+ | $100K+/year | Talent ID, coaching education |

### Development Phases

| Phase | Timeline | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Foundation | Months 1-3 | Core similarity engine, tracking data pipeline |

| 3. Product | Months 7-9 | Dashboard, API, video integration |
| 4. Scale | Months 10-12 | Second customer, sales process |

## Part 3: How They Connect

### The Tactical Framework

Both products share the same underlying model of football:
- Decisions have measurable value
- Context determines what works
- Patterns emerge from data

**The game teaches this intuitively. The engine measures it precisely.**
